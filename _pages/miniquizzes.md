The mini-quizzes cover material from the lectures, and are graded for *completion credit*. Typically, a mini-quiz is assigned before each lecture and due after the following lecture. We believe they are a useful tool to check your understanding of the material and to prepare for the quiz. As long as you have submitted a *reasonable* attempt on Gradescope, you will receive *full credit* for the miniquiz.
